# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 22
### Summary
I reviewed every symbol I learned in the past. I checked my codes that I worked few days ago. I think I got all the basic symbols.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 23
### Summary
I wrote what I thought the codes mean. I used Anki that was in .py. It was very hard but I guessed the best I could.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 24
### Summary
I used the things we learned before in this exercise. I made no mistake. It works fine.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 25
### Summary 
This exercise was interesting. I was not running it but actually importing it. I am getting better and better.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 26
### Summary
I fixed all the errors. This was the most difficult exercise. I hate it.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 27
### Summary
I studied the symbols. True and False was memorized by me (wierd grammar). I understand it 100%.

# 2017/03/28
## LPTHW : 28
### Summary
